A class MaxHeapTrea was created which contains a method that takes an array
of integers and rearanges them in order to sutisfy the max heap condition

EX:

input: { 16, 4, 10, 14, 7, 9, 3, 2, 8, 1 }

heap tree:
"""
            16
          /    \
        4        10
      /   \     /   \
    14     7   9      3
  /   \    /
 2    8    1
 """

  output: { 16, 14, 10, 8, 7, 9, 3, 2, 4, 1 }

  max heap tree:
"""
            16
          /    \
       14        10
     /     \     /  \
    8       7   9    3
  /   \     / 
 2     4   1
